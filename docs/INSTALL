Installation
------------

Since you're looking at a file in the source package, we assume you want to
compile from sources -- if you just want to use qtparted, your OS may have
a binary ready to go. (e.g. on Ark Linux, install the qtparted-data package
and the qtparted package if you wish to use qtparted on X11, or the
qtparted-nox package if you wish to use qtparted on a framebuffer console)


Compiling
---------

Requirements:
  - Qt 4.5.0
  - libparted >= 1.6.6
  - Header files for Qt 4.x, libparted, and the things they depend on
  - A fairly modern C++ compiler (gcc 4.5.2 is tested)
  - cmake

If you're e.g. on Ark Linux, install the following packages to fill the needs:
  qt-core-devel
  qt-gui-devel
  qt-compat-devel
  parted-devel
  gcc-c++
  libstdc++-devel
  cmake

To build QTParted, do ($ indicates commands run as user, # commands run as root):

  $ cmake . (or ccmake . if you wish to change config options)
  $ make
  # make install
