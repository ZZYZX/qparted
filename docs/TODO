TODO for QtParted (http://qtparted.sourceforge.net)
***************************************************

1) Source Code:
===============

MINOR-TODO (trivial changes):
-----------------------------
- Support for Resier4 (detection only)
- Support for flags: lba, ...
  (boot and hidden already supported)
- Conversion from ext2 to ext3
- Set maximal length of text in format/create dialogs:
  maxname for xfs label = 12
  maxname for ext2/ext3 = 16
- allow to resize ext3 without converting to ext2
- Check if the partition is mounted. Before working on the disk,
  it would be possible to use the isMounted() function. It tells
  us whether or not a partition is mounted.
- configure script: check Qt is multithreaded (qt-mt)

MAJOR-TODO (bug features):
--------------------------
- Merge convertfs
- Bad blocks checking


BUGS:
-----
- When shrinking an extended partition, the minimal size is not correct

General TODO:
-------------
- in the GUI, new column:
  FreeSpace (there is "total space", and "used space" only)
  but the user can need to have the "free space"
  Make the user choice which columns to show in the list
- Change the partition flags
  In the current version, we have "set active"
  - Add "hide partition" and "show partition"
- Graphical interface
  - CreatePartitionDialog:
    - new layout with dialog-resizing support
    - graphical size selector (like in the resizeDialog)
  -

2) Administration jobs:
=======================
- make the debian files work for creating DEB packages
- test and build the Redhat packages
- create a mailing list:
  partgui-announce@lists.sourceforge.net
  Announce new versions. Private list (low trafic)
